This repo contains of all the data preparation steps I took to clean the data and also the visuals and dashboards that I have created.
Data is in excel format and I have also included the excel file in this repo. 
I have created most of the visuals using plotly graphical objects and plotly express.
With the visuals I created in plotly, I then used it to create 2 dashboards using Dash library in Python.
Dash allows me to have interactivity and cross filtering between visuals.
